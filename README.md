# Weather_Images_Classification_Sagemaker

The objective of this project is to perform multi-class image classification using AWS Sagemaker. The model was deployed using AWS Sagemaker Endpoint and made avaialble via Lambda function.

In this project I used the built-in image classification model provided by AWS Sagemaker, retrained using the weather images dataset, performed hyper-parameter tuning and finally deployed the model as Endpoint.
